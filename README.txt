An array of buildings is facing the sun. The heights of each building from West to East is given in an integer array. You have to tell which buildings will be able to see the sunset. 
Write a program that prints how many buildings and which buildings will be able to see the Sunset given the Array of building heights: [3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 9]. 
The output should look something like this: 4 --> [3, 4, 7, 9]
